# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Topology for Data Science (T4DS) is a two-day workshop designed to introduce undergraduates to data science and topology. Participants will gain experience with the topological data analysis (TDA) pipeline, and will apply the new knowledge to investigating the changing shape of glaciers in Glacier National Park. The T4DS Workshop is co-Organized by Dr. Brittany Fasy and Ben Holmgren with support from the National Science Foundation and the  Gianforte School of Computing at Montana State University.
